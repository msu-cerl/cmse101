# CMSE 101: Introduction to Machine Learning and Society

**Michigan State University**  

---

## üìò Course Description

CMSE 101 is a general education course designed for students from all majors to explore the conceptual foundations and societal implications of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Through interactive modules, independent media, and real-world case studies, students will critically examine how these technologies shape‚Äîand are shaped by‚Äîour lives.

## üéØ Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain how ML/AI systems work at a conceptual level.
- Identify and analyze bias in data and algorithms.
- Evaluate the societal, ethical, and environmental impacts of AI.
- Reflect on how AI affects their personal and professional lives.
- Communicate clearly about AI with technical and non-technical audiences.
- Make informed decisions about the use of AI in various contexts.
